### 🎓 M.A. student in sociology, National Taiwan University 國立臺灣大學 社會學研究所 碩士生

#### 🏥 Research Topics  
My research interest lies within the STS community, ranging from medical diagnosis to information management infrastructures. 

#### 👩‍💻 Academic Work
- Making use of what I learned during my EE major in undergrad, I'm working as part-time research assistants at both National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica.
- I do **data crawling, cleaning and analysis** on social media data with *R, Python, a little bit of JavaScript/C++ and experience on Unix-like environments*. 
- I'm looking forward to becoming a **computational social scientist** in the near future.
